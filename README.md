# Snippets

## Overview
Share your impressive code snippets. Write your code in the editor of your choice and publish it using the *snippet* command line tool.

Built using Go and React following the clean architecture.

## Work in progress
- User specific commits: Allow users to track their commits and add user specific stats (# of contributions etc)
- Show site wide stats: Display popular tags.
- Installable *Snippet CMD*.

## Setup
- The *Snippet CMD* command line tool is built using Go. *Snippet CMD* is currently not available as an installable. If you want to run it on your system a Go installation is required. Clone this project and *cd* into the *cmd* folder. Run *go install*. With your Go installation and *$GOPATH* set you should be able to use *snippet cmd* system wide.
